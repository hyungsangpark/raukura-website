			<p class="center">Our Year 9 students and their whānau were formally welcomed to Raukura on Wednesday, January 31 along with new students and staff.</p>

			<p class="center">Hohaia Macfarlane delivered his inaugural speech as 2018 Head Prefect.</p>

			<img src="../resources/Powhiri/Hohaia_web.jpg" alt="A picture of Our 2018 Head Boy, Hohaia Macfarlane." class="center" id="Hohaia">

			<p>“I have been granted the honour to stand before you today, as your Head boy for 2018,”</p>

			<p>“First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge our Principal Mr Grinter;  our Deputy Principals Mr Whata, Mr Buckton and Mr Lockwood.  I acknowledge all the school’s staff:  Deans and teachers;  my Prefect team; parents of the school, and all of you, the students.”</p>

			<p>“To our new year 9 boys, welcome.”</p>

			<p>“For some of you this will be an exciting day. For some of you, it will be daunting. Seeing you here takes me back to my first day as a year 9.  My emotions were running wild. I was excited, yet petrified at the same time.”</p>

			<p>“Coming from Intermediate where most of the students were only a year older than me, to a school where the year 13’s looked almost 30…was overwhelming to say the least.  But I had other new students on either side of me feeling exactly the same.”</p>

			<img src="../resources/Powhiri/IMG_3569.jpg" alt="A picture of our new Year 9 students, sitting down at a grass and chair." id="newStudents" title="Our New Year 9 Students">

			<p>“It didn’t take long for me to realise that I was actually surrounded by the encouragement of caring and supportive people;  my teachers, the older students and role models, and my friends.  I recognised the special bond that you will see around you today.  Look around you. We are brothers. This is the brotherhood of Raukura.  We are all here to help, encourage, and motivate one another.”</p>

			<p>“When an opportunity arises, take it.  Follow your passion.  Set yourself goals.  Whether these goals   are  to make the stage for Raukura Kapa haka;  the field for the 1st XV, or even to be the Head Prefect when you reach year 13…visualise your goal.”</p>

			<p>“Keep visualising your goal, so you stay focused and motivated.  There is no short cut to achievement.  Not everything is easy.  Nor should it be easy.  You will come across challenges on the road to your goals, but these challenges are only to test you.  They are there to sort out those who are able to put to one side, the aggravation of the moment in order to achieve the long term goal.  Follow you dreams, whether it be sporting, academic, cultural or musical.  Listen and trust the advice of your teachers and family…and think Big!”</p>

			<p>“It is an absolute honour to have been elected Head Prefect of the school I call my second home, and to represent a brotherhood of which I am immensely proud to be a part of.”</p>

			<p>“I wish you the best of luck for the year gentlemen.”</p>

			<p>“Na reira Tena Koutou, Tena koutou, Tena koutou katoa.”</p>
