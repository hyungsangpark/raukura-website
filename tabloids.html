			<p class="center">We were provided with a scorching hot day for the 2018 Interhouse Tabloids.</p>

			<img src="../resources/Tabloids/rayna.jpg" alt="A picture of Frobisher boys." style="width: 100%;">

			<p>With 18 games to test teamwork, individual skill, strength and speed, the boys ripped into and enjoyed a fun afternoon as they attempted to take out the first major competition of the year.</p>

			<p>It was also a colourful afternoon as the boys boys brought into the team spirit and wore their house colours proudly. Staff also added some colour for their respective Houses and they pushed our boys along as they took on each challenge.</p>

			<p>Tabloids is one of the schools favourite events and participation numbers increase every year which is fantastic to see.</p>

			<p>Following the Tabloids and for the first time, the Inter House 4x100m Relay also took place for Juniors, Intermediates and Seniors.</p>

			<p>There were some real flyers out there which bodes well for the upcoming Mid Islands Athletics Events.</p>

			<p>In the Junior Event, Nelson proved too quick as the defeated a close challenge from Raleigh House who were also too good for Drake and Frobisher as they came in 3rd and 4th respectively.</p>

			<p>Frobisher bounced back to take out the Intermediate Race as Drake House blew a commanding lead after dropping the baton. While Drake did well to hang on to 2nd place, Raleigh fought off a spirited attack from Nelson to take out 3rd place.</p>

			<p>Drake House again took a commanding lead in the Senior event only to once again drop the baton which opened the door for Nelson House to scamper through for the win. The door was open wide enough for Raleigh to squeeze through to take 2nd place, however Frobisher had it shut on them to finish 4th.</p>

			<p>Thanks to all involved in making this a fun and memorable event once again.</p>
